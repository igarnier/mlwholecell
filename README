The "Andrea Weisse/Peter Swaine" whole-cell model, in Objective Caml. Uses CVODE for numerical integration through
the SundialsML OCaml interface.

To compile the models either use OPAM, or edit make.sh and replace `opam config var lib`/sundialsml 
by the actual directory where SundialsML is installed. 

A gnuplot script is provided for visualisation: after successful execution, the command
  gnuplot base_model.gp
should do the job (replace base_model.gp with the name of the .gp file corresponding to
the particular cell model).
